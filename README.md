Hi, I'm Federico Farias a Computer Systems student at the Institute of Science in Universidad Nacional General Sarmiento.

As you can see almost all my projects that I'm working on are written in Java and JavaScript but I'm looking forward to learn more languages and frameworks.

If you wanna reach me you can send me and email to federicofarias@outlook.com
