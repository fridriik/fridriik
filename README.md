Hi, I'm Federico Farias a student of BS in Information Systems at the Universidad Nacional General Sarmiento.

As you can see almost all my projects that I'm working on are written in Java and JavaScript but I'm looking forward to learn more languages and frameworks.

If you wanna reach me you can send me and email to federicofarias@outlook.com
